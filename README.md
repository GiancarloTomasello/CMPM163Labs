1. The first cube on the left is made by mixing two colors together based on the time the program has been running. It utilizes a sin function so the colors will slide from one color, to a mix of colors, and finally to the other.

2. The second cube is made based on the lab code by utilizing a shader to mix two colors together based on the location of the vertices of the object the marterial is applied to

3. The third cube from the left is based on the lab notes and is a green spining cube created by using th phong materials in three.js
 
4. The last cube was made using the phong materials in three.js where I changed some setting such as raising the shininess and added a slight emission

From Left to Right

1. This is the  tiling cube. To create this one I set tge texture to RepeatWrapping and set the repeat setting to 4 (I wanted a 4x4 grid) and in the shader I scaled down the UV vector by .25 so that each square was the correct size.

2. This cube was created by using the THREE.MeshPhongMaterial function and loading a texture and a normal map to create depth

3. This was the first cube and it was made by loading a texture into the phong material function in THREE.JS

4. This cube was created by using the THREE.MeshPhongMaterial function and loading a texture and a normal map to create depth

5. This cube was created by loading a texture with shader code

* UV Questions

A. (u x 8) - 1 = x

B. (v x 8) - 1 = y

C. White (2,1)
